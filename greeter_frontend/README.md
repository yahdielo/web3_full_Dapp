Go to public/index.html and change the title and meta description of your website. This step is optional.

Next, go to the src folder and delete the "App.test.js", "logo.svg", and "setupTests.js" files. We will not be needing these files.

Go to the App.js and delet everything inside and replace it with this snipped

    import './App.css';

    function App() {
     return (
         <h1>Hello World</h1>
        );
    }   

    export default App;

you should see a big **Hello World** on the top left of your template
